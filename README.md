# PingWizard

The Ping Wizard streamlines ping tests with a user-friendly interface, enabling effortless input of parameters like destination, packet count, size, and interval. Simplifying the ping testing process, it executes commands seamlessly, making tests accessible and customizable.

Let's break down the "Ping Wizard" script step by step:

Import Necessary Modules:

python
Copy code
import subprocess
This module is used for running shell commands.

Define Input Function:

python
Copy code
def get_user_input(prompt, example):
    return input(f"{prompt} (e.g., {example}): ")
A function to get user input with a prompt and example.

Define Ping Function:

python
Copy code
def ping(destination, count, size, interval):
    command = f"ping -c {count} -s {size} -i {interval} {destination}"
    subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
A function to construct and execute the ping command based on user-provided parameters.

Define Main Function:

python
Copy code
def main():
    # User-friendly welcome message
    print("\nWelcome to the Ping Python Script!")

    # Get user input for destination, count, size, and interval
    destination = get_user_input("\nEnter the IP Address or hostname to ping", "example.com or 8.8.8.8")
    count = get_user_input("\nEnter the number of packets to send", "4")
    size = get_user_input("\nEnter the size of each packet in bytes", "64")
    interval = get_user_input("\nEnter the interval between packets in seconds", "1")

    # Call the ping function with user-provided parameters
    ping(destination, count, size, interval)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
The main function orchestrates the script execution by getting user input and calling the ping function.

Script Summary:
The script serves as a user-friendly interface for conducting ping tests. It prompts the user to input parameters such as the destination (IP or hostname), the number of packets to send, the size of each packet, and the interval between packets. The script then constructs and executes a ping command with these parameters.

Purpose:
The purpose of the script is to simplify the process of conducting ping tests by providing a user-friendly interface. Users can easily input the desired parameters for the ping command, and the script takes care of executing the command and displaying the results. It aims to make the ping testing process accessible and customizable for users.
